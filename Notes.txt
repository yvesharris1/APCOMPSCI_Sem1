AP Comp Sci Notes: Introduction to Programming

1. Computer Programs are Just Text Files
	~all you need is a simple text editor to write a Java program
	~the written code is called an assembly code and it's stored in a 
	regular text file with a .java extension

2. Setting up the JDK
	~the JDK contains the files necessary to "compile" and "execute"
	your code

	+example of code+
	
	public class name
	{
		public static voide main (String[]args)
		{
			System.out.println("--------");
		}
	}

3. ASCII Art

	~ASCII art is part of the graphic design world that is used to project 
	art through text based visual art in computers
	~ASCII art came out to be as it is because old printers lacked the ability
	to project any reasonable art
	~ASCII art can be seen earlier than 1939
	~ASCII art also has different forms of font
	~Another form of visual art through text that predated ASCII art is typewriter art
	~ASCII art became popular in the late 1970s

4. Escape Characters 
	
	~each character in coding has a significance and meaning
	~when a character is in front of a "\" it could potentially be an escape character
	~for example, "\t" means tab and in coding will project a large gap or space
	~escape characters in a way are short cuts
